Seq matrix multiplication
by Feng Li, Jan 2017

Comparison of six different version of sequential matrix multiplication. PAPI is used to analyze the performance.

how to:
    1. run Make to build the project
    2. bigred.job is the sample batch file, which will generate all the temporary and summary results 

RESULTS:
    Results_O0: without complier optimization
    Results_O3: with complier optimization

see the source file for more details


Lab2:
    use fix matrix size
    loop rolling
        try loop size 1,2,4,8
        outer loop step
    
    blocking:
        block size 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048
        innner loop step
