Seq matrix multiplication using blocking algorithm and loop unrolling
by Feng Li, Feb 2017

Using optimization Techniques such as loop unrolling and blocking  to improve sequential matrix multiplication. PAPI is used to analyze the performance.

how to:
    1. run Make to build the project
    2. run_lab2.job is the sample batch file, which will generate all the temporary and summary results 

Cofiguratios
    you can change block size and loop size in run_lab2.job file

RESULTS:
    Results will be saved in results/jobid/ directory

DOCS;
    there is a report and spreadsheet of experiment results in .Report/ folder
